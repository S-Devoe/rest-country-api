## Overview

### The challenge

- Integrate with the [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.com) to pull country data and display it like in the designs.

Users should be able to:

- See all countries from the API on the homepage
- Search for a country using an `input` field
- Filter countries by region
- Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
- Click through to the border countries on the detail page
- Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode *(optional)*

### What I learned

    This project looks easy at first glance and it was all going well

    until it was time to pull data from the API. I started with a mobile

    first layout and scaled up to tablet and then desktop view. I used

    CSS flexbox for the layout of the countries in the mobile view, and
    
    CSS Grid for tablet and desktop layout.

    I was able to learn how to pull data from an API using JavaScript 
    
    fetch. After fetching the data some bugs popped out of no where, i
    
    was able to figure them out with the aid my Terminal and it was due
    
    to some country's name not being in English or having hyphen "-" in
    
    between their names. i was able to solve this by using javaScript
    
    regular expression (and also with the help of Google üòÅ).
